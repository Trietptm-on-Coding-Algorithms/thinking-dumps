thinking-dumps
==============

This repo keeps track of my codes, answers and thinkings when exploring books.

I like to learn things by repeating what others have done, from which I'd like to find something new.

So I name this repo "Thinking dumps".

Please feel free to use the codes or share your thinking with me.

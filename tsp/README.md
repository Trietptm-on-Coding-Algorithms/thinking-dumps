## Travelling Salesman Problem

I was reading the book
[The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study (Princeton Series in Applied Mathematics)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Computational/dp/0691129932)
(the chinese version:
[迷茫的旅行商：一个无处不在的计算机算法问题](http://www.amazon.cn/%E8%BF%B7%E8%8C%AB%E7%9A%84%E6%97%85%E8%A1%8C%E5%95%86-%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E6%97%A0%E5%A4%84%E4%B8%8D%E5%9C%A8%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98-%E7%BE%8E-William-J-Cook/dp/B00M2DL24Q/)). There
are several algorithms mentioned in the book. I feel itch to try
implement them out as I read those algorithms. So comes this project.

### Roadmap

The project includes the implementations of differenting algorithms
solving the TSP. Here's a list of algorithms I planned to work on:

* [ ] Brutal force algorithm
* [ ] Nearest-neighbor algorithm
* [ ] Greedy algorithm
* [ ] Insertion algorithm
** [ ] Cheapest
** [ ] Farthest
** [ ] Nearest
** [ ] Random
* [ ] 2-Opt Algorithm
* [ ] 3-Opt Algorithm

All codes will be written in Haskell.

# Coursera: Parallel programming

My homework solution for the MOOC [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/parprog1) on Coursera provided by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne taught by Prof. Viktor Kuncak and Dr. Aleksandar Prokopec.

## Note

This is the third course of the series [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala). I have done the previous two before, see [progfun](../progfun), [progfun2](../progfun2).

## learn you an agda and achieve enlightenment

My codes following this guide is put here. This is my first trial on
the agda programming language. In total, it's somewhat interesting and
impressive. Comparing to Coq, Agda looks more 'functional', the main
idea is filling 'holes' rather than using tactics to manipulate
hypotheses and goals. Agda is mostly like the concept of proofscript
in Coq, while agda is more interactive on building a proofscript/agda
proof.

In total, it's a nice trial. I have interest to study more on agda.

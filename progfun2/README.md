# Coursera: Functional Program Design in Scala

This course is the successor to the [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](../progfun). The course schema has been adjusted since I learnt that one, so there's some overlapping in contents.

## Contents

- Week 1: For Expressions and Monads
- Week 2: Lazy Evaluation
- Week 3: Functions and State
- Week 4: Timely Effects

## Notes

The week 2 homework is about implementing a DFS solver for the Bloxorz game, which I have already done in the predecessor course for the last week's homework, the solution works but doesn't get a full score.

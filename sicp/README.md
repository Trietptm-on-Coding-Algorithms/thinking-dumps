## SICP
In this repo are my solutions to the exercises in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

### Note
These was my answer to the exercises in SICP. For my reading notes, please move on to [my blog](http://shouya.github.io/sicp-notes/).

Mistake reportings are welcomed, so please feel free to let me know :)


### Missing solutions
Some solutions might have not been submitted to this
repository. Firstly all those before section 2.1 are relatively easy
and I solved them earily on my notebook, so I won't write them again
here.

Second, I don't have idea for some questions, so those won't appear
here behovely. Furthermore, for some exercises don't ask for coding
and perhaps codes are not good solutions for them, I won't wrote my
code here. You can always visit my note page to see how I conceive
solutions for each answers and my feelings about them. I will take a
note even if an exercise's not submitted to this repository, so visit
my note pages :)


### Format

In chapter 2 I use a directory to store each exercises as files. I
found this way not very efficient since if I could merge all exercises
in the section into one file, I could have access to the context of
each exercise and take note easily. So from section 3, I will use a
whole racket source file to put all my exercises and notes.

There's a trouble to take note in this way, that some examples will be
replaced later and I can't maintain the old code together. So I will
use block-comment to comment out these parts.

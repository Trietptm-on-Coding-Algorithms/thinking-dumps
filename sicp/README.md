## SICP
In this repo are my solutions to the exercises in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

### Note
These was my answer to the exercises in SICP. For my reading notes, please move on to [my blog](http://shouya.github.io/sicp-notes/).

Mistake reportings are welcomed, so please feel free to let me know :)


### Missing solutions
Some solutions might have not been submitted to this repository. Firstly all those before section 2.1 are relatively easy and I solved them earily on my notebook, so I won't write them again here.
Second, I don't have idea for some questions, so those won't appear here behovely. Furthermore, for some exercises don't ask for coding and perhaps codes are not good solutions for them, I won't wrote my code here. You can always visit my note page to see how I conceive solutions for each answers and my feelings about them. I will take a note even if an exercise's not submitted to this repository, so visit my note pages :)

```racket
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond [(number? exp) 0]
        [(variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0)]
        [else
         ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp) var)]))

(define operator car)
(define operands cdr)
```

## a. explain what above code does

the first two rules are the same.

the third uses a generic method similar to the complex number one.

`get` takes an operation and a type and return a function that handles
it. then it apply the operands and variables are arguments to the
corresponding function. can't be more intuitive.

## b. write rules for sum and product exprs

```racket
(define (sum operands expr)
  (let ([op1 (car operands)]
        [op2 (cadr operands)])
    (list '+
          (deriv op1 var)
          (deriv op2 var))))

(put 'deriv '+ sum)


(define (product operands expr)
  (let ([op1 (car operands)]
        [op2 (cadr operands)])
    (list '+
          (list '* (deriv op1 var) op2)
          (list '* (deriv op2 var) op1))))

(put 'deriv '* product)
```

## c. add your own deriv rules, e.g. exponential

```racket
;; (u^v)' = (e^vlnu)' = e^vlnu * (v'lnu + v/u)

(define (expo ops var)
  (let* ([op1 (car ops)]
         [op2 (cadr ops)]
         [pow (list '* op2 (list 'ln op1))])
    (list '*
          (list '^ 'e pow)
          (deriv pow var))))

(put 'deriv '^ expo)

;; etc, this really isn't challenging so I only write one for fun
```

## d. swap position of type and operation

```racket
((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)
```

there's really nothing different. only the semantic.

before the swapping, we read it as 'deriv on "plus"', now we read it as
'for plus, the operation "deriv"'.

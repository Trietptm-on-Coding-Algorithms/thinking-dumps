## generic operaions with explicit disp

```racket
(define (magnitude z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
         (magnitude-rectangular (contents z)))
        ((polar? z)
         (magnitude-polar (contents z)))
        (else (error "Unknown type -- MAGNITUDE" z))))
```

* add new type: update all functions like this, you need access to the
  whole definition of all other packages.
* add new func: just add a new function and specify dispatching
  for different types.


## data directed

```racket
(define (imag-part z)
  (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))

(put 'imag-part '(polar) imag-part)
```

* add new type: write a group of operaions for that type, and make
  a `install-package` function that register all operations using
  `put`.
* add new func: just write the impl for different types and make a
  different `install-package` function to register the impl. this is
  very flexible.


## message passing

```scheme
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (define (dispatch op)
    (cond ((eq? op 'real-part) x)
          ((eq? op 'imag-part) y)
          ((eq? op 'magnitude)
           (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y))))
          ((eq? op 'angle) (atan y x))
          (else
           (error "Unknown op -- MAKE-FROM-REAL-IMAG" op))))
  dispatch)
```

* add new type: just write a new constructor for the type and all
  corresponding functiosn in the constructor definition.
* add new func: you need to update all constructors if this op applies
  to all types. otherwise you only need to update the one related.


## conclusion

overall. the data directed style seems to be a more flexible way to
construct data. if you just want to design a system with new types
frequently added, then message passing would be appropriate as well.
